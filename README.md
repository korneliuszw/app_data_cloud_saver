## About
Tired of losing save files for your games? Or maybe you just want to upload your notes everytime you finish working with certain app?
Using this app you can set your executable and file you wish to save to the dropbox cloud, and everytime you close it, it just uploads straight to your dropbox drive.


## Disclaimer:
This project was made for hackaton, late at night, therefore most of the code is pretty bad.
I intend to fix it, but it will take time since a lot of improvements need to be done.

**FILE UPLOADING NOW WORKS, BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE ISSUES, PLEASE WAIT FOR FIRST RELASE**
