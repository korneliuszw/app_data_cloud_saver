## About
Tired of losing save files for you games? Or maybe you just want to upload your notes everytime you finish working with certain app?
Using this app you can your executable and file you wish to save to the dropbox cloud, and everytime you close it, it just uploads straight to your dropbox drive.


## Disclaimer:
This project was made for hackaton, late at night, therefore code is pretty bad.
Maybe one day I will make it better.
Also, in this state it's very unsafe to use, planning to make it safer (i'm unwraping everywhere lol)

**FILE UPLOADING NOW WORKS, BUT THERE MULTIPLE ISSUES, PLEASE WAIT FOR FIRST RELASE**
